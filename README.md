## Purpose

This portfolio was created as part of my coursework for the 7822ICT Work-Integrated Learning (WIL) Placement. It serves as a platform to demonstrate my skills and accomplishments during my internship.

## WIL Placement

During my internship at [GilmourSpace Technologies](https://www.gspacetech.com/) in Gold Coast, Australia, I had the opportunity to work on exciting projects and gain valuable experience in the field. You can learn more about my internship experience and the projects I worked on by visiting the GilmourSpace Technologies website.
